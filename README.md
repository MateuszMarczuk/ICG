# ICG
A mobile application for the decision support process in cardiology.
To create this apliction I use Andorid Studio, REST architecture and Java language.

# How it's working ?
The ICGR recorder measures the patient and saves the results to the CSV file, then sends the file to the server.
This application downloads this file from the server and extracts all necessary diagnostic data from it.
After parsing the file, the result is presented on the screen of the mobile device and the diagnostic data is sent to the AMULET platform
